# Calendar
I made a java version of the unix cal program.
Each program is a little different. The first program, Cal.java, can only accept args.length 0 and 2.
The Cal1.java program can also accept one command line argument and prints out an nxm calendar of a specifed year. The args.legnth 0
just prints out the current month and the args.length 2 prints out the specifed month of a specified year.
